\end{figure}

In this section we introduce selective applicative functors, which we will
further refer to as simply \emph{selective functors}, for brevity. We start by
defining the new abstraction, and then use it in~\S\ref{sec-combinators} to
implement several simple combinators, such as the aforementioned \hs{whenS}.
In~\S\ref{sec-instances} we provide several examples of selective functors, and
discuss the relationships between applicative functors, selective functors, and
monads. In~\S\ref{sec-laws}, these relationships are further elaborated and
expressed as a set of laws that all selective functors are required to satisfy.

Like applicative functors~\citep{mcbride2008applicative}, selective functors
provide a way to embed pure values into an effectful context \hs{f} using the
function \hs{pure}, and give meaning to composition of two \emph{independent}
effectful computations using the operator \hs{<*>}. See Fig.~\ref{fig-types} for
the standard definition of the corresponding type class \hs{Applicative}.
Selective functors enrich the applicative interface with the \hs{select}
function, which gives meaning to the composition of two effectful computations,
where, in contrast to \hs{<*>}, the second computation \emph{depends} on the
first one:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
class Applicative f => Selective f where
    select :: f (Either a b) -> f (a -> b) -> f b
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
One can think of \hs{select} as a selective function application:
parametricity~\citep{wadler1989theorems} dictates that, when given a
\hs{Left}~\hs{a}, we \emph{must execute the effects} in
\hs{f}~\hs{(}\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b)}, apply the obtained function to \hs{a}, and
return the resulting \hs{b}; on the other hand, when given a \hs{Right}~\hs{b},
we \emph{may skip the effects} associated with the function, and return the
given \hs{b}.

Following the notational convention for applicative operators, we also define
the infix operator alias \hs{<*?} for \hs{select}: the angle bracket pointing to
the left means we always use the corresponding value; the value on the right,
however, may be skipped, hence the question mark.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{haskell}
($)     :: (a -> b) -> a -> b                               -- Function application
(.)     :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c                   -- Function composition
id      :: a -> a                                           -- Identity function
const   :: a -> b -> a                                      -- Constant function
flip    :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c                     -- Flip function arguments
uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c                     -- Uncurry a function
foldr   :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b                   -- Reduce a list to a value
bool    :: a -> a -> Bool -> a                              -- Deconstruct a Bool
maybe   :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b                    -- Deconstruct a Maybe
either  :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c          -- Deconstruct a Either
first   :: (a -> c) -> Either a b -> Either c b             -- Map over Left
second  :: (b -> c) -> Either a b -> Either a c             -- Map over Right
bimap   :: (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> Either a b -> Either c d -- Map over Left and Right
void    :: Functor f => f a -> f ()                         -- Discard an effect's value
\end{minted}
\caption{Type signatures and descriptions of standard operators and functions
used throughout the paper.}\label{fig-std}
\end{figure}

One can implement \hs{select} using monads in a straightforward manner: examine
the value produced by \hs{f}~\hs{(Either}~\hs{a}~\hs{b)} with the bind operator,
and then, in the \hs{Left}~\hs{a} case, execute the subsequent effect
\hs{f}~\hs{(a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b)}, passing the \hs{a} to it using the
\hs{Functor}'s map operator, as shown below. We will use~\hs{<@\fmap@>}, an
infix synonym of \hs{fmap}, throughout the paper (see Fig.~\ref{fig-types} for
\hs{Functor}'s API).

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
selectM :: Monad f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> b) -> f b
selectM x y = x >>= \e -> case e of Left  a -> ($a) <$> y -- execute y
                                    Right b -> pure b     -- skip y
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Many monads directly use \hs{select}~\hs{=}~\hs{selectM} in their \hs{Selective}
instance definitions, and in \S\ref{sec-laws} we argue that this should in fact
be a law when both \hs{Selective}~\hs{f} and \hs{Monad}~\hs{f} instances exist.
Note that some monads, e.g. the \Haxl monad (\S\ref{sec-haxl}), choose to
implement the  \hs{select} method differently for performance reasons, but they
still satisfy the law \hs{select}~\hs{=}~\hs{selectM} at the semantic level.

One can also implement a function with the type signature of \hs{select} using
applicative functors, but it will always execute the effects associated with the
second argument, rendering any conditional execution of effects impossible, as
in the \hs{pingPongA} example in~\S\ref{sec-intro}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
selectA :: Applicative f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> b) -> f b
selectA x y = (\e f -> either f id e) <$> x <*> y
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Fig.~\ref{fig-std} gives type signatures and short descriptions for standard
functions \hs{either}, \hs{id}, and other convenient functional combinators that
we use in this paper.

While \hs{selectM} is useful for \emph{conditional execution} of effects,
\hs{selectA} is useful for \emph{static analysis}. As we will see
in~\S\ref{sec-instances}, the above definition is sometimes useful, for example,
selective functors used for static analysis need to collect information about
all possible effects instead of skipping some of them, hence directly using
\hs{select}~\hs{=}~\hs{selectA} in their \hs{Selective} instance definitions.

Any \hs{Applicative} instance can thus be given a \hs{Selective} instance. The
opposite is also true in the sense that one can recover the operator \hs{<*>}
from \hs{select} as follows:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
apS :: Selective f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
apS f x = select (Left <$> f) (flip ($) <$> x)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Here we tag a given function \hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b} with \hs{Left} and turn a
value of type \hs{a} into the reverse application function
\hs{\}\hs{a}~\hs{f}~\hs{->}~\hs{f}~\hs{a}, which yields \hs{b} when given
\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b}, as desired. Since the \hs{Right} case is impossible, the
effect \hs{f}~\hs{a} is executed unconditionally. Note however, that the
equality \hs{(<*>)}~\hs{=}~\hs{apS} does not always hold. Selective functors
that satisfy the law \hs{(<*>)}~\hs{=}~\hs{apS} will be called \emph{rigid};
they will turn out to have a particularly simple normal form, which we will
exploit in the free construction in~\S\ref{sec-free}.

We will come back to the relationship between applicative functors, selective
functors and monads in \S\ref{sec-laws}, after first exploring \emph{selective
combinators} that can be written using the selective interface
(\S\ref{sec-combinators}), and looking at some concrete examples of selective
functors (\S\ref{sec-instances}).

\subsection{Selective combinators}\label{sec-combinators}

As a first use-case of the interface provided by selective functors, let us
revisit our ping-pong example from~\S\ref{sec-intro} and implement the
combinator \hs{whenS}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
whenS :: Selective f => f Bool -> f () -> f ()
whenS x y = selector <*? effect
  where
    selector = bool (Right ()) (Left ()) <$> x -- NB: convert True to Left ()
    effect   = const                     <$> y
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
We first bring the given effectful computations into the right shape by using
the \hs{Functor}'s map operator. Specifically, \hs{x}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{Bool}
is converted into a \hs{selector}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{(Either}~\hs{()}~\hs{())},
and \hs{y}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{()} is converted into
\hs{effect}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{(()}~\hs{->}~\hs{())}. The results are composed
using the select operator \hs{<*?}, and the meaning of this composition is
determined by the supplied \hs{Selective}~\hs{f} instance. For example, an
instance like \hs{f}~\hs{=}~\hs{IO} would skip \hs{y} if \hs{x} yields
\hs{False}, as exploited by our implementation of \hs{pingPongS}. On the other
hand, instances used for static analysis would record both \hs{x} and \hs{y} as
possible effects. See more examples in~\S\ref{sec-instances}.

It is worth noting that unlike the select operator, whose implementation is
almost completely determined by parametricity (i.e., the only real question is:
\emph{``To skip, or not to skip?''}), \hs{whenS} admits a variety of (incorrect)
implementations. In particular, due to \emph{Boolean blindness}\footnote{The
term refers to the fact that the \hs{True} and \hs{False} values are not
distinguished at the type level, see~\citet{boolean-blindness}.},
it is easy to inadvertently implement \hs{unlessS}, which has the same type but
flips the meaning of the Boolean value. The ability to reason parametrically was
one of the guiding principles we used when looking for a good abstraction for
selective functors: \hs{select} provides this ability, whereas \hs{whenS} does
not.

% Constraints liberate, liberties constrain
% Dijkstra: "Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague …
% The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic
% level in which one can be absolutely precise."

A strong contender for playing the leading role in selective functors is the
function \hs{branch} that, given an effectful computation
\hs{x}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{(Either}~\hs{a}~\hs{b)}, selects which subsequent
computation, namely \hs{l}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{(}\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{c)} or
\hs{r}~\hs{::}~\hs{f}~\hs{(}\hs{b}~\hs{->}~\hs{c)}, to execute:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
branch :: Selective f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> c) -> f (b -> c) -> f c
branch x l r = fmap (fmap Left) x <*? fmap (fmap Right) l <*? r
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{haskell}
whenS :: Selective f => f Bool -> f () -> f ()
whenS x y = select (bool (Right ()) (Left ()) <$> x) (const <$> y)

branch :: Selective f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> c) -> f (b -> c) -> f c
branch x l r = fmap (fmap Left) x <*? fmap (fmap Right) l <*? r

ifS :: Selective f => f Bool -> f a -> f a -> f a
ifS x t e = branch (bool (Right ()) (Left ()) <$> x) (const <$> t) (const <$> e)

(<||>) :: Selective f => f Bool -> f Bool -> f Bool
x <||> y = ifS x (pure True) y

(<&&>) :: Selective f => f Bool -> f Bool -> f Bool
x <&&> y = ifS x y (pure False)

fromMaybeS :: Selective f => f a -> f (Maybe a) -> f a
fromMaybeS x mx = select (maybe (Left ()) Right <$> mx) (const <$> x)

anyS :: Selective f => (a -> f Bool) -> [a] -> f Bool
anyS p = foldr ((<||>) . p) (pure False)

allS :: Selective f => (a -> f Bool) -> [a] -> f Bool
allS p = foldr ((<&&>) . p) (pure True)

whileS :: Selective f => f Bool -> f () -- Run a computation while it yields True
whileS x = whenS x (whileS x)
\end{minted}
\caption{A library of selective combinators. The names and order of parameters
are inherited from the standard Haskell library. For example, \hs{fromMaybeS}
corresponds to the standard
\hs{fromMaybe}~\hs{::}~\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{Maybe}~\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{a} and
retains the short-circuiting behaviour, i.e. if the second argument yields a
\hs{Just}, the first argument is skipped.}
\label{fig-library}
\end{figure}

% Add `orElse` and `andAlso' combinators?

\noindent
While we encourage the reader to derive an implementation of \hs{branch} as an
exercise, we would like to share our intuition behind it, as it will be useful
for \emph{free selective functors} in~\S\ref{sec-free}. The select operator
allows us to eliminate one of the cases in a sum type, namely the
\hs{Left}~\hs{a} case in \hs{Either}~\hs{a}~\hs{b}, leaving the other case
intact. To implement \hs{branch}, we will need to apply \hs{<*?} twice,
eliminating \hs{a} and \hs{b} one after another. The first application is tricky
because \hs{f}~\hs{(Either}~\hs{a}~\hs{b)} and
\hs{f}~\hs{(}\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{c)} do not match the type signature of \hs{<*?}.
To fix the mismatch, we convert them to
\hs{f}~\hs{(Either}~\hs{a}~\hs{(}\hs{Either}~\hs{b}~\hs{c))} and
\hs{f}~\hs{(}\hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{Either}~\hs{b}~\hs{c)}, respectively. The second
application of \hs{<*?} is then straightforward.

As will be discussed in~\S\ref{sec-alt-branch}, we could have chosen to use
\hs{branch} instead of \hs{select} as the method of the \hs{Selective} type
class. Our choice of \hs{select} follows the Occam's razor principle:
\hs{select} is simpler than \hs{branch}, which, in particular, leads to a
simpler free construction (\S\ref{sec-free-construction}).

By instantiating \hs{select} with \hs{a}~\hs{=}~\hs{b}~\hs{=}~\hs{()} we have
earlier obtained \hs{whenS}. Below we repeat the same trick but with
\hs{branch}, obtaining another familiar conditional combinator \hs{ifS}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
ifS :: Selective f => f Bool -> f a -> f a -> f a
ifS x t e = branch selector (const <$> t) (const <$> e)
  where
    selector = bool (Right ()) (Left ()) <$> x -- NB: convert True to Left ()
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Many conditional combinators, which are typically associated with the \hs{Monad}
type class, can be expressed using selective functors, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig-library}, making them reusable in new contexts. In particular, the
logical combinators \hs{<||>} and \hs{<&&>} will play an important role in
improving the efficiency of the \Haxl framework in~\S\ref{sec-haxl}. To
emphasise the monadic flavour of selective functors, we can rewrite \hs{ifS} in
the form of the bind operator specialised to \hs{Bool}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
bindBool :: Selective f => f Bool -> (Bool -> f a) -> f a
bindBool x f = ifS x (f False) (f True)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
This can be achieved not only for \hs{Bool}, but for any \emph{enumerable}
type, as we will discuss in \S\ref{sec-selectivedo}.

\subsection{Examples of selective functors}\label{sec-instances}

Having explored various useful combinators that can be implemented on top of the
minimalistic selective interface, in this section we look at several examples of
selective functors.

As we have observed at the beginning of this section, any monad can be given a
\hs{Selective} instance simply by using \hs{select}~\hs{=}~\hs{selectM} as the
definition. As an example, below we define a selective instance for \hs{IO}, and
test the function \hs{pingPongS} from \S\ref{sec-intro} in an interactive GHC
session:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
instance Selective IO where
    select = selectM

@\ghci@ pingPongS = whenS (("ping"==) <$> getLine) (putStrLn "pong")
@\ghci@ pingPongS
hello
@\ghci@ pingPongS
ping
pong
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
As desired, the effect \hs{putStrLn}~\hs{"pong"} occurs conditionally.
In~\S\ref{sec-free-ping-pong} we will see how to statically analyse
\hs{pingPongS}, i.e. obtain a list of all possible effects \emph{before the
execution}, which can be done by interpreting \hs{pingPongS} in the selective
functor \hs{Over}, introduced below.

The \hs{Const}~\hs{m}~\hs{a} functor is an interesting instance of the
\hs{Applicative} type class, which stores no values of type \hs{a}, but keeps
track of the applicative structure in the monoid value of type \hs{m}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
newtype Const m a = Const { getConst :: m }
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
instance Functor (Const m) where
    fmap _ (Const x) = Const x
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
-- 'mempty' and '<>' are the identity and the binary operation of the Monoid m
instance Monoid m => Applicative (Const m) where
    pure _              = Const mempty   -- pure values have no effects
    Const x <*> Const y = Const (x <> y) -- collect effects in x and y
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
It turns out there are two useful selective instances for \hs{Const}. To
disambiguate between them, we will call them \hs{Over} and \hs{Under},
reusing\footnote{Fortunately, thanks to the new GHC extension
\textsf{DerivingVia}~\citep{blondal2018deriving}, we can reuse \hs{Const}
instances without duplicating any code, simply by adding
\hs{deriving}~\hs{(Functor,}~\hs{Applicative)}~\hs{via}~\hs{(Const}~\hs{m)} to
the \hs{newtype} definitions.}
the above \hs{Functor} and \hs{Applicative} instances:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
newtype Over  m a = Over  { getOver  :: m }
newtype Under m a = Under { getUnder :: m }

instance Monoid m => Selective (Over m) where
    select (Over x) (Over y) = Over (x <> y) -- collect effects in x and y
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
instance Monoid m => Selective (Under m) where
    select (Under x) _ = Under x             -- discard conditional effects
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The selective functor \hs{Over} can be used for computing a list of all possible
effects embedded in a computation, i.e. an \emph{over-approximation} of the
effects that will actually occur. This is achieved by keeping track of effects
in both arguments of \hs{select}. The selective functor \hs{Under}, on the other
hand, discards the second argument of \hs{select}, and therefore computes an
\emph{under-approximation}, i.e. a list of effects that are guaranteed to occur.

\noindent
Let us give these two instances a try:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ ifS (Over@\,@"a") (Over@\,@"b") (Over@\,@"c") *> Over@\,@"d" *> whenS (Over@\,@"e") (Over@\,@"f")
Over {getOver = "abcdef"}
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ ifS (Under@\,@"a") (Under@\,@"b") (Under@\,@"c") *> Under@\,@"d" *> whenS (Under@\,@"e") (Under@\,@"f")
Under {getUnder = "ade"}
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
As expected, \hs{Over} collects all effects, whereas \hs{Under} does not look
beyond ``opaque'' conditions. A deeper difference between them is that \hs{Over}
is a rigid selective functor (i.e. \hs{<*>}~\hs{=}~\hs{apS}), but \hs{Under} is
not: indeed, \hs{Under}~\hs{"a"}~\hs{<*>}~\hs{Under}~\hs{"b"} records both
\hs{"a"} and \hs{"b"}, but \hs{apS}~\hs{(Under}~\hs{"a")}~\hs{(Under}~\hs{"b")}
records just \hs{"a"} since \hs{apS} is implemented via the under-approximating
\hs{select}. Intuitively, non-rigid selective functors have a much richer
structure, because \hs{<*>} is not expressible via \hs{select}, which will
significantly complicate the corresponding free construction
(\S\ref{sec-free-construction}).

Our last example in this section is the selective functor
\hs{Validation}\footnote{Applicative functors \hs{Const} and \hs{Validation}
appeared under the names \hs{Accy} and \hs{Except} in
\citep{mcbride2008applicative}.}, which is useful for validating complex data:
if reading one or more data fields has failed, all errors are accumulated (using
the operator \hs{<>} from the semigroup \hs{e}) to be reported together:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
data Validation e a = Failure e | Success a deriving (Functor, Show)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
instance Semigroup e => Applicative (Validation e) where
    pure = Success
    Failure e1 <*> Failure e2 = Failure (e1 <> e2) -- Accumulate errors
    Failure e1 <*> Success _  = Failure e1
    Success _  <*> Failure e2 = Failure e2
    Success f  <*> Success a  = Success (f a)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The error-accumulating behaviour cannot be extended to a \hs{Monad} instance,
since the bind operator has nothing to bind to if the first computation fails.
We can, however, define the following \hs{Selective} instance, which allows us
to validate data in the presence of conditions.

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
instance Semigroup e => Selective (Validation e) where
    select (Success (Right b)) _ = Success b
    select (Success (Left  a)) f = ($a) <$> f
    select (Failure e) _ = Failure e -- NB: Failed conditions are opaque
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Here, the last line is particularly interesting: similarly to \hs{Under}, we
discard the second argument, but \emph{only if the first has failed}. This
allows us not to report any validation errors that are hidden behind a failed
conditional (we do not know whether the corresponding fields are actually
needed).

Below we define a function that constructs a shape (a circle or a rectangle)
given a choice of the shape \hs{x}, and the shape's parameters (\hs{r}, \hs{w},
and \hs{h}) in an arbitrary selective functor \hs{f}. You can think of the
inputs as results of reading the corresponding fields from a web form, where
\hs{x} is a checkbox, and all other fields are numeric textboxes, some of which
may be empty.

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
type Radius = Word; type Width = Word; type Height = Word
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
data Shape = Circle Radius | Rectangle Width Height deriving Show
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
shape :: Selective f => f Bool -> f Radius -> f Width -> f Height -> f Shape
shape x r w h = ifS x (Circle <$> r) (Rectangle <$> w <*> h)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
We choose \hs{f}~\hs{=}~\hs{Validation}~\hs{[String]} to report the errors that
occurred when reading values from the form. Let us see how this works.

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ shape (Success True) (Success 1) (Failure ["width?"]) (Failure ["height?"])
Success (Circle 1)
@\ghci@ shape (Success False) (Failure ["radius?"]) (Success 2) (Success 3)
Success (Rectangle 2 3)
@\ghci@ shape (Success False) (Success 1) (Failure ["width?"]) (Failure ["height?"])
Failure ["width?", "height?"]
@\ghci@ shape (Failure ["choice?"]) (Failure ["radius?"]) (Success 2) (Failure ["height?"])
Failure ["choice?"]
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
In the last example, since the shape's choice could not be read, we do not
report any subsequent errors. But it does not mean we are short-circuiting the
validation: we will continue accumulating errors as soon as we get out of the
opaque conditional, as demonstrated below.

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
twoShapes :: Selective f => f Shape -> f Shape -> f (Shape, Shape)
twoShapes s1 s2 = (,) <$> s1 <*> s2
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ s1 = shape (Failure ["choice 1?"]) (Success 1) (Failure ["width 1?"]) (Success 3)
@\ghci@ s2 = shape (Success False) (Success 1) (Success 2) (Failure ["height 2?"])
@\ghci@ twoShapes s1 s2
Failure ["choice 1?","height 2?"]
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Like \hs{Under}, the \hs{Validation} instance is not a rigid selective functor,
since \hs{select} occasionally discards effects in the second argument.

\subsection{Laws}\label{sec-laws}

It may be illuminating to compare the following type signatures:

\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
(<**>) :: Applicative f => f a            -> f (a -> b) -> f b
select :: Selective   f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> b) -> f b
(>>=)  :: Monad       f => f a            -> (a -> f b) -> f b
\end{minted}

The type signature of \hs{select} is reminiscent of both \hs{<*>} and \hs{>>=},
and indeed a selective functor is in some sense a composition of an applicative
functor and the \hs{Either} monad.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
------------------------------------- Laws: ------------------------------------
-- Identity
@\blk{x}@ <*? pure id = either id id <$> x

-- Interchange
@\blk{x}@ *> (y <*? z) = (x *> y) <*? z

-- Associativity
@\blk{x}@ <*? (y <*? z) = (f <$> x) <*? (g <$> y) <*? (h <$> z)
  where
    f x = Right <$> x
    g y = \a -> bimap (,a) ($a) y
    h z = uncurry z

-- For selective functors that are also monads:
select = selectM
---------------------------------- Theorems: -----------------------------------
-- Apply a pure function to the result:
f <$> select x y = select (second f <$> x) ((f .) <$> y)

-- Apply a pure function to the Left case of the first argument:
select (first f <$> x) y = select x ((. f) <$> y)

-- Apply a pure function to the second argument:
select x (f <$> y) = select (first (flip f) <$> x) (flip ($) <$> y)

-- General interchange
x <*> (y <*? z) = (f <$> x <*> y) <*? (g <$> z)
  where
    f ab = bimap (\c ca -> ab (ca c)) ab
    g ca = ($ca)

-- For rigid selective functors and monads:
(<*>) = apS
\end{minted}

Note that it is not a requirement for selective functors to skip unnecessary
effects. It may be counterintuitive, but this makes them more useful. Why?
Typically, when executing a selective computation, you would want to skip the
effects (saving work); but on the other hand, if your goal is to statically
analyse a given selective computation and extract the set of all possible
effects (without actually executing them), then you do not want to skip any
effects, because that defeats the purpose of static analysis.
