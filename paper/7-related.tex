\section{Related work}\label{sec-related}

Composing effectful computations is a rich research area and there is a vast
body of related works. We build on the fundamental notions of applicative
functors~\citep{mcbride2008applicative} and
monads~\citep{moggi1991notions,1995_wadler_monads}, but these notions are not
isolated points in space: the landscape between them is inhabited by
\emph{arrows}~\citep{hughes2000arrows} and \emph{generalised
arrows}~\citep{megacz2011hardware}, which we discuss in~\S\ref{sec-arrows}.

The idea of extending the \hs{Applicative} interface with new methods to gain
additional expressive power is not new. In particular, there are several works
in the area of \emph{parser combinators}, where static analysis of parsers is
desirable because it allows for their automated optimisation.
\citet{swierstra1996parsers} used an extended version of applicative functors
which was later abstracted into \hs{Alternative} type class, which we discuss
in~\S\ref{sec-alternative-functors}. Other extensions include combinators for
\emph{observable recursion}, e.g.
see~\citep{devriese2012finally,devriese2013fixing}.

Our free construction for rigid selective functors is inspired by the works
on free applicative functors~\citep{free-applicatives} and free
monads~\citep{swierstra2008data}, as well as by insightful blog posts
by~\citet{fancher2016free,fancher2017static}.

\subsection{Arrows}\label{sec-arrows}

Arrows, introduced by~\citet{hughes2000arrows}, generalise monads by making the
\emph{input} of a computation explicit. Rather than giving the type
\hs{f}~\hs{a} to an effectful computation that yields a value of type~\hs{a}, as
we have done in this paper so far, arrows give the type \hs{a}~\hs{i}~\hs{o} to
an effectful computation (an \emph{arrow}~\hs{a}) that takes values of type
\hs{i} as input and yields values of type \hs{o} as output.

See \citet{lindley2011idioms} and \citet{rivas2017notions} [...]

    select (ArrowMonad x) y = ArrowMonad $ x >>> (toStatic y ||| returnA)

toStatic (ArrowMonad f) = arr (\x -> ((), x)) >>> first f >>> arr (uncurry ($))

\subsection{Parsers and \hs{Alternative} type class}\label{sec-alternative-functors}

\hs{Alternative} is a type class originally motivated by non-monadic parsers;
see, for example,~\citet{swierstra1996parsers}, where the methods of the
\hs{Alternative} type class appear as part a bigger \hs{Parsing} type class. In
modern Haskell, \hs{Alternative} is a subclass of \hs{Applicative}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
    empty :: f a
    (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The operator \hs{<|>} allows us to naturally express \emph{choice} in parsers.
As an example, consider the task of parsing binary and hexadecimal numbers,
which are prefixed with \hs{"0b"} and \hs{"0x"}, respectively. Following the
classic parser combinator approach~\citep{hutton1998monadic}, let us assume the
existence of the following parsers:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
sat    :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char   -- parse a specified character
string :: String         -> Parser String -- parse a string literal
bin    ::                   Parser Int    -- parse a binary-encoded number
hex    ::                   Parser Int    -- parse a hexadecimal-encoded number
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Now the desired parser can be obtained as a choice between parsers for binary
and hexadecimal numbers, each augmented with the prefix-parsing part:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
numberA :: Parser Int
numberA = (string "0b" *> bin) <|> (string "0x" *> hex)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
When parsing \hs{"0x7E3"}, the first parser fails (due to the prefix mismatch),
but the second one succeeds. Note that parsing of the leading \hs{"0"} can be
factored out into a separate parser \hs{string}~\hs{"0"} to avoid backtracking.

Selective functors also allow us to implement the desired parser, and arguably
in a more direct style that does not involve trying one parser after another:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
numberS :: Parser Int
numberS = ifS ((== 'b') <$> (string "0" *> sat (`elem` "bh"))) bin hex
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
Here we first parse the leading \hs{"0"}, then the second character of the
prefix, failing if it is neither \hs{"b"} nor \hs{"h"}, and finally select an
appropriate subsequent parser using \hs{ifS}.

Investigation of the relationship between \hs{Alternative} and \hs{Selective}
type classes, as well as application of selective functors to parsers is left
for future work.
